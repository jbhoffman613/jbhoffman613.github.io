								<h2>How I got Here</h2>
								<h3>June 1, 2021</h3>
								<p>Academia and getting your Ph.D. are black boxes that little light (in the form of information) seems to ever escape. While I all I have is my little view of the world as a Northeastern Alum and first year PhD student at UT Austin, I hope that maybe my experiences and stories may help someone else along their post-grad journey whether it is into grad school, a company, or non-profit, or forging their own path in life.</p>
								<p>So, how did I find myself here. I was fortunate enough to attend <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> where I received my B.S in computer science (and nothing more; later I’ll address while I do not have a masters, and why you don’t need one to get a PhD). For the record, I LOVED my time there, and I wouldn’t have traded it for the world. As an aside, one summer during my undergrad, I spent a summer in Israel on an internship program with other students from top schools all over the US. I quickly realized that, personally, I was not missing out on much. </p>
								<p>As part of the Northeastern undergrad experience, you need to do co-ops. For the unfamiliar, a co-op is a 6-8 month internship that is undertaken in place of taking classes during that time. When I’m feeling more confident, I’ll share about my first co-op, but it left me with the sense that perhaps software engineering isn’t for me. </p>
								<p>However, for my second co-op, I was a full-stack engineer at a start-up in the Washington D.C. area called <a href="https://www.datamachines.io" target="_blank">Data Machines</a>, and the experience was more than I could’ve asked for: I beyond treasured my time there. This start-up was led in part by many people who possessed a PhD in computer science, and I, in large part, credit them with my desire to get a PhD. </p>
								<p>My mentors made it very clear that if I wanted to be a competitive applicant, I needed to spend some time actually doing research, so for my second co-op, I joined Chris Amato’s <a href="https://llpr.ccs.neu.edu" target="_blank">Lab for Learning and Planning</a>, and I had the opportunity to work with Yuchen Xiao. I was able to assist on two publications under Yuchen, and I had a workshop paper accepted to <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/HEAT/AAAI20_UC_Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank">AAAI-UG</a>. </p>
								<p>Following this experience, I applied to 13 schools, and one of them was obviously UT Austin which is how I find myself here writing this. </p>
								<p>So if you have any desire to enter a Ph.D., I recommend getting involved in research as soon as possible, and finding supportive mentors that will help get you there.</p>
